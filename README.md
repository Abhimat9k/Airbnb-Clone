# Airbnb-Clone
This project is an Airbnb website design clone, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript integration where I recreated the visual appearance and user interface of the popular accommodation rental platform.
This website is responsive on various devices.

Just like the original Airbnb, this clone allows users to search and discover various short-term lodging options, connecting hosts offering accommodations with guests seeking a place to stay.

# Features:
• Interactive homepage with a prominent search bar for destination, dates, and guest details.

• filtering options to refine search results based on price, property type, amenities, and more.

• Detailed property listings with images, descriptions, amenities, and reviews.

• Property pages displaying comprehensive information about each accommodation.

• Responsive design, ensuring seamless user experiences across different devices.

# Technologies Used:
HTML and CSS for front-end development.

This project is a website design clone and does not include the full back-end functionality or actual booking capabilities. It serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my Front-end development skills and my ability to recreate complex user interfaces.
